This platform is implemented in MPython Jupyter Notebook.
In the following, you can see the instruction to run the code:

Required Libraries:

numpy==1.21.5
pandas==1.4.2
torch==1.3.1+cpu
scikit-learn==1.1.3
skorch==0.12.1
seaborn==0.11.2
matplotlib==3.5.1


Instructions:

- make sure all the files in the provided zip file are in the same directory
- run test.ipynb on a jupyter notebook to test both MLP and SVM models and produce results 
- run train.ipynb" on a jupyter notebook to train MLP and Svm models



Guidelines for the Project:
-> For Testing the final models the preprocessed data is used(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test.
-> The new datasets are provided in the .zip folder but can also be reproduced by running the Train.ipnynb python notebook.
